## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user enters personal and medical details (e.g., Glucose Level, Blood Pressure) into the input fields on the homepage.
2. The app processes the input using a pre-trained **Random Forest Classifier**.
3. The app displays the result:
   - **Oops! You are at risk of diabetes** (if the prediction is positive).
   - **Great! You are not at risk of diabetes** (if the prediction is negative).
4. Developer contact details and social links are displayed for further assistance.
